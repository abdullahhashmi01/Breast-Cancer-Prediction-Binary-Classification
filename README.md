* Developed a binary classification model to predict whether a breast mass is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

### Technical Skills and Methodologies
* **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis, checked for missing values, and handled data duplicates to ensure data quality.
* **Machine Learning:** Implemented a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using key metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix**.

### Results and Achievements
* Achieved an accuracy of **97%** on the test dataset.
* Demonstrated strong performance with a precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.99 for the benign class, and 0.98 precision and 0.95 recall for the malignant class.
